Goals of project: 
a) use terminal to create a folder (use terminal command "mkdir" instead of "touch")
b) create a repo on github (hit the + icon and select new repository)
c) bring copy of new repo from github to terminal and into the odin project folder (copy the SSH line generated from github for the repository, then paste it [Ctrl + Shift + V] after command "git clone [paste SSH repo here]")
d) create README.md file within "google-homepage" folder (use command touch "README.md")
e) edit README.md file with list of objectives for assignment (open up VS studio and hit the 2 papers icon on top left and "open file" then find README.md file within the_odin_project folder and double click on it)
f) use LiveServer extension (we have to go to VS code editor, and chose "File"-> "Open Folder" and pick the folder where our website is located, we tried wrongly and picked "Open File," but "Open Folder" is the correct option, also we have to save our changes in VS editor before they will update on the browser, and remember to turn off LiveServer when done)
g) wow, we had a dickens of a time trying to insert the google image into our google webpage project; the notation is '<img src="[image link here]" alt="[description of image here]">' which we thought we used initially , but it only loaded the text of our website, it basically loaded just the code, not sure why this happened, but we redid it, and then the image actually showed up; honestly we're not sure what we did the second time, but it did work then; we also added the <h1> and <p> elements before our image, these are usually text descriptions before an image, thinking we needed them to display the image, but no, we can just use the <img> element; it's pretty frustrating to see that we essentially did the same thing in the correct version, and the bugged version, and we're not sure what the difference was lol, sometimes just erase code and reinput works?
h) we're having a ton of trouble trying to get the placement of the words in the html document at the proper positions, and googling doesn't seem to explain it enough, and inspecting the Google homepage is even more confusing lol... we know it has something to do with the CSS, but we just don't know how to do it
